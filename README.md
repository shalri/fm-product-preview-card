- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Prettier Tailwind Plugin
- ViteJS

### What I learned

I used React to implement the solution for this challenge. Since I plan
to integrate Frontend Mentor into my study routine, I might as well play around
with React alongside the challenges.

Using CSS `clamp()` gives granular control over the styling. This is the first
time I really dug into it, and I have to say, I have been missing out. I also
leaned heavily on the `grid` for this challenge. This is outside my comfort zone
since I usually just `flex` it! ðŸ˜Š

This challenge showed the importance of a `.fig` file. I spent most of the time
pixel-pushing to set the dimensions, spacing, and layout just right. I am proud of the results since I was only eyeballing it.

### Continued development

I look forward to doing more challenges from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I like learning and practicing new concepts.
